Cloning the project

Studying the examples
---------------------

To get you started quickly, we have created a set of examples that show the very minimal player code for the most typical use cases (look for word "minimal" in the example name). You should start studying from these short and to-the-point examples, preferably in the presented order as the examples get gradually more complex.

For more advanced usage, we have created a set of examples that focus on a particular Orion360 feature, such as VR mode or hotspots. When you have mastered the basics, these examples will become valuable sources for adding new features to your 360 player app.

Example: Minimal Video Stream Player
------------------------------------

An example of a minimal Orion360 video player, for playing a video file from local file system.

Example: Minimal Video Stream Player
------------------------------------

An example of a minimal Orion360 video player, for downloading a video file before playback.

Notice that saving a copy of a video file while streaming it is not possible with Android MediaPlayer as a video backend. To obtain a local copy of a video file that resides in the network you need to download it separately, as shown in this example.

Example: Minimal Video File Player
----------------------------------

An example of a minimal Orion360 video player, for playing a video file from local file system.

Showcases all supported file system locations and access methods (select one from code).
